# EVA-8_Phase-1_Assignment-4
This is the assignment of 4th session in phase-1 of EVA-8 from TSAI. 

## Introduction
### Objective:
Objective of this assignment is to build a CNN based network which will take [MNIST Handwritten Dataset](<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>) and will achieve targets as mentioned below.
- Upto `99.4%` test accuracy.
- Using total parameters count of under 10,000.
- Test accuracy should be consistant and need to be achieved till training reaches 15th epoch.

While achieving above mentioned target code needs to be writtern under certain conditions as mentioned below:
1. Target should be achieved in more then 3 steps in a gradual fashion. Means there should be more then 3 versions of the code where each code will be progressive in nature.
2. Each code version should have a target, result and analysis block showing what was the target of that code and what were the results and your analysis.

### Repository setup:
This repository contains 4 folders, each folder contains colab copy of notebook of the training code and a model architecture image. Below are the information about the following folders.
- `step_1/` - This folder (as name suggest) contains colab copy of notebook of first step i.e. first code setup `step_1/EVA_assignment_4-step1.ipynb`. 
- `step_2/` - This folder contains colab copy of notebook of second step i.e. second code setup `step_2/EVA_assignment_4-step2.ipynb`
- `step_3/` - This folder contains colab copy of notebook of third step i.e. Third code setup `step_3/EVA_assignment_4-step3.ipynb`
- `step_4/` - This folder contains colab copy of notebook of fourth step i.e. fourth code setup `step_4/EVA_assignment_4-step4.ipynb`
- `Bonus_step/` - This assignment has a bonus part in which same target should be achieved in less then 8,000 parameters for bonus points. So this folder contains colab copy of notebook of that extra bonus step code setup `Bonus_step/EVA_assignment_4-Bonusstep.ipynb`

This means that required target is achieved in four steps and an extra step to achieve bonus target.
